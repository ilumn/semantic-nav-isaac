goal_adapter_core.py — Pure math for Stage-5 nav goal adapter.

Converts a target object position into a safe approach pose:
    (target_x, target_y)  →  (goal_x, goal_y, goal_yaw)

The approach pose is offset back from the target along the robot-to-target
direction so the robot stops *approach_distance* metres away and faces
the object.

No ROS dependency.
